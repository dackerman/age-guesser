## Java Unit Testing tutorial with an example

This is the working repository for the example used in my "How to
write a Unit Test in Java" tutorial.

See the branch
[`1-initial-code`](https://github.com/dackerman/age-guesser/tree/1-initial-code)
for the initial code, and
[`2-refactored-main`](https://github.com/dackerman/age-guesser/tree/2-refactored-main)
for the refactored code later in the article.

See the full article at
[https://fullstack.industries/blog/how-to-write-a-unit-test-in-java](https://fullstack.industries/blog/how-to-write-a-unit-test-in-java)
with a walk-through of how to write unit tests in Java.

For most IDEs, you should be able to simply clone the project and
import it, then run the tests. Let me know at
[contact@fullstack.industries](mailto://contact@fullstack.industries)
if you have trouble!
